# Vehicle-detection-using-YOLO
Using YOLO architecture, we have built this model to classify vehicles from the below dataset in Kaggle repository with 16 K + images.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lyensoetanto/vehicle-images-dataset/data

Fine modifications are made and we have trained the YOLO model for 200 epochs in the code file named “Modified_YOLO_Notebook_for_vehicles_data.ipynb”
Importantly the trained weights were “Pickled” such that the learned weights can be reused on the dataset. i.e., directly testing can be done in the notebook
